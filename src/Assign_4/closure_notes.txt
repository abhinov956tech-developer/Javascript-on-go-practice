 Common Pitfalls to Avoid
Post-Increment vs. Pre-Increment:

count++ returns the old value, then increments.

++count increments first, then returns the new value.
Use the right one based on whether you need the old or new value.

Closure Scope:
Ensure count is declared inside createCounter (not in the returned object) to keep it private.
