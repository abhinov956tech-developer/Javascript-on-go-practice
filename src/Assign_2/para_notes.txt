Key Improvements
Avoid Scope Traps: Donâ€™t define reusable functions inside other functions unless you intentionally want to limit their scope (e.g., closures).
Name Parameters Clearly: Use names like operation or callback instead of calcFunction to avoid confusion.
Keep Code Flat: Unnecessary nesting (like your calcFunction wrapper) makes code harder to debug and reuse.

Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Final Tip: Always structure code for reusability and clarity. Separate function definitions from testing logic! ðŸš€
